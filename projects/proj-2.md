title: 'Water Pump'
---

I collaborated with four other students to research, design, manufacture, and test a water pump. We opted for a Scotch-Yoke piston pump design, which featured a two-sided, double-acting mechanism. We were able to pump water at a rate of 10.5 L/min, highly exceeding the projectâ€™s expectation of 1 L/min. Throughout this project, I enhanced my manual machining, organization, CAD (Fusion 360), part drawings, teamwork, communication, leadership, and assembly abilities.
